# Tailwind CSS: Build & Deploy ‚Äî Production-Ready PWA

> **AI Assistance Disclosure:** This lesson draws from classroom experience since September 2024, with AI iterations following research‚Äìpractice‚Äìresearch cycles.

## üé≠ Critical Coding Approach

This lesson follows the **atelier methodology** (exploration ‚Üí reflection ‚Üí conceptualization ‚Üí production ‚Üí exhibition). We build not to automate, but to **articulate** ‚Äî giving form to thought through rhythm, reflection, and resistance.

- **Exploration:** Understanding build processes and deployment strategies.
- **Reflection:** Considering how deployment affects user experience and accessibility.
- **Conceptualization:** Connecting build optimization to sustainability and ethics.
- **Production:** Creating production-ready applications with PWA features.
- **Exhibition:** Demonstrating polished, deployable web applications.

## Prerequisites

<div class="prerequisites">
  <h3>üìö Before Starting</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Completed S1‚ÄìS5:</strong> Full Tailwind SPA with components, state, and optimizations</li>
    <li><strong>Build tools:</strong> Understanding of npm scripts and bundling</li>
    <li><strong>Git and GitHub:</strong> Repository management and GitHub Pages setup</li>
    <li><strong>Static hosting:</strong> Experience with deployment platforms</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## üöÄ Production Builds: From Development to Deployment

**Production builds** transform development code into optimized, deployable applications. Key differences include:

- **Bundle optimization:** Minification, tree-shaking, and asset optimization
- **Environment variables:** Different configurations for dev vs. production
- **Asset handling:** Hashed filenames, CDN optimization, lazy loading
- **Performance monitoring:** Analytics and error tracking setup

Our approach creates **production-ready PWAs** that can be installed, work offline, and provide native app-like experiences.

## S6 ‚Äî Build & Deploy (Production, PWA, GitHub Pages)

This session focuses on building optimized production bundles and deploying to static hosting platforms.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Configure Vite for production:**

   ```javascript
   // vite.config.js
   import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

   export default defineConfig({
   	base: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '/your-repo-name/' : '/',
   	build: {
   		outDir: 'dist',
   		assetsDir: 'assets',
   		sourcemap: false, // Disable for production
   		minify: 'terser',
   		rollupOptions: {
   			output: {
   				manualChunks: {
   					vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'], // If using React
   				},
   			},
   		},
   	},
   });
   ```

2. **Add PWA manifest:**

   ```html
   <!-- public/manifest.json -->
   { "name": "Tailwind Portfolio", "short_name": "Portfolio", "description": "Modern portfolio built with Tailwind CSS
   and Vite", "start_url": "/", "display": "standalone", "background_color": "#ffffff", "theme_color": "#3b82f6",
   "icons": [ { "src": "/icons/icon-192.png", "sizes": "192x192", "type": "image/png" }, { "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
   "sizes": "512x512", "type": "image/png" } ] }
   ```

3. **Add manifest link to HTML:**

   ```html
   <!-- index.html -->
   <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json" />
   <meta name="theme-color" content="#3b82f6" />
   ```

4. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Verify production build:**

   ```bash
   # Serve dist folder locally to test
   npx serve dist

   # Check that all assets load correctly
   # Verify PWA install prompt appears
   # Test offline functionality
   ```

6. **Configure GitHub Pages:**

   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

7. **Create deployment workflow:**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
    push:
     branches: [main]
    workflow_dispatch:

   permissions:
    contents: read
    pages: write
    id-token: write

   concurrency:
    group: 'pages'
    cancel-in-progress: false

   jobs:
    build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
         node-version: '20'
         cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
         path: './dist'

    deploy:
     environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     needs: build
     steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   ```

8. **Add deployment documentation:**

   ````markdown
   <!-- README.md -->

   # Tailwind Portfolio

   Modern portfolio built with Tailwind CSS, Vite, and vanilla JavaScript.

   ## Development

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   ````

   ## Build & Deploy

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

   ```

   ```

9. **Test PWA features:**

   - Install the app from browser
   - Test offline functionality
   - Verify service worker registration
   - Check app manifest properties

10. **Commit your production-ready application:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: S6 - Production build + PWA features + GitHub Pages deployment"
    ```

## üéì Pedagogical Explanations

### Production Build Optimization

**Vite's build process** transforms development code into production-ready assets:

**Bundle analysis:**

- **Tree shaking:** Removes unused code
- **Code splitting:** Splits code into smaller chunks for faster loading
- **Asset optimization:** Compresses and hashes files for caching

**PWA features:**

- **Service workers:** Enable offline functionality and background sync
- **Web app manifest:** Defines how the app appears when installed
- **Caching strategies:** Improve performance and offline experience

### Deployment Considerations

**Static hosting** provides global CDN distribution but requires specific configurations:

**GitHub Pages specifics:**

- **Base path:** Must match repository name for subpath deployment
- **HTTPS:** Required for PWA features and modern web APIs
- **Custom domains:** Can be configured for production use

**Performance monitoring:**

- **Core Web Vitals:** Track real-world performance metrics
- **Error tracking:** Monitor JavaScript errors and user interactions
- **Analytics:** Understand user behavior and conversion metrics

## Atelier Critical Questions

Following our **atelier methodology**, reflect on these questions:

### Exploration

- What changed most significantly between your development and production builds?
- How did the deployment process reveal previously unnoticed issues?

### Reflection

- How does your deployment story and hosting choice affect end users?
- What performance trade-offs did you make for production optimization?

### Conceptualization

- What makes a project "ready" to show to others versus "ready" for users?
- How does the build process relate to software sustainability and maintenance?

### Production

- Is your README clear and comprehensive for future contributors and maintainers?
- How maintainable is your build and deployment configuration?

### Exhibition

- What narrative will you present with your live, deployed site?
- How will you invite critique and demonstrate the evolution from S1 to S6?

## Critical Prompts

### Reflection Prompts

- How does Tailwind's build process change your approach to production code?
- What is the relationship between development experience and production reality?
- How can critical coding shape our understanding of software deployment and distribution?
- How does your deployed application represent your journey as a developer?

### Ethics Prompts

- Whose infrastructure and labor enable your application's deployment and hosting?
- How do your build optimizations affect users with different devices and connections?
- What happens when deployment requirements conflict with accessibility or performance needs?

### Technical Philosophy Prompts

- Is "build optimization" more about performance or about developer experience?
- How does the build-deploy process relate to concepts like reproducible builds?
- What does it mean to "deploy responsibly" in terms of environmental and social impact?
