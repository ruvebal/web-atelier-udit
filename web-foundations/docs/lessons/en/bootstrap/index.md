# Bootstrap CSS Learning Path — Complete Roadmap

This **six-session roadmap** teaches students with basic HTML/CSS knowledge how to build a **modern, responsive portfolio site** using **Bootstrap** as a learning tool for web development concepts. We combine **concise theory** with **hands-on coding** in each lesson: students learn a concept, see how Bootstrap implements it, and then practice by adding it to their site. Emphasizing a **mobile-first, responsive design approach** (as defined by [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)), the course covers setup (via CDN or npm), layout grids, components, customization, interactivity, and deployment. Each session has **clear objectives** and ends with a **short coding exercise or mini-project**, reinforcing the theory with practice.

## Session Overview
